### What I worked on today.
Today's task was to take a string from the user and convert it into its encrypted form, and also decryt the string if the user entered the encrypted form.
I am still figuring out how the input and encryption will take place, and I do not intend to push a program which is complete yet a more boring version of this program.
Anytime I am able to figure out the exact input logic and python3 it out, the program will be pushed in this repo.
