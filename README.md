## Hello World!
>I have taken up this challenge in order to work on my Python basics. Each day I will dedicate at least one hour to coding and write programs implementing whatever new things I learned.

**Now for the detailed version.**

I don't have a definite plan. I will do as much as my free time and sleep permit. But the best part is, this initiative will help me learn things I actually want to learn. I also tried to wrap up my new friends in this. Let's see if they actually respond.
```sh
$ python3
>>> print("Just keep swimming.") 
```
